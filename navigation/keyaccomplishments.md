My key accomplishments were mainly as a coder, with me discovering how to code in Mermaid, like below:

My key accomplishments also include learning how to make a game using Javascript, like shown at [https://ahmad-se-tech.github.io/tablegroup/custompong](https://ahmad-se-tech.github.io/tablegroup/custompong), where I made a pong game with the help of my friend Matt.

Another key accomplishment I had as a coder was learning about one of the fundamentals which correlated to what I was doing and teaching about it, as seen [here](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/js/nested-conditionals)

Also, I learned how to ask AI to achieve what I want to achieve without completely taking the backseat and making it do all the work.
